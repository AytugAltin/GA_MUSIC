\subsubsection{Type distribution rating}\mbox{}\\
This fitness function compares the occurrence rates of the different types of elements and compares them with the occurrence rate of the master. The sub-functions are used: 
\[ Rate_{Notes}(x) = \frac{\textit{Number of notes in x}}{\textit{Total number of elements in x} } \]
\[ Rate_{Chords}(x) = \frac{\textit{Number of chords in x}}{\textit{Total number of elements in x} } \]
\[ Rate_{Rests}(x) = \frac{\textit{Number of rests in x}}{\textit{Total number of elements in x} } \]


The type distribution score will be calculated with the following rating function. The type distribution rating of a song $x$ with master $m$ is calculated by the following formula:

\[ TypeDistributionScore(x) = \]
\[abs(Rate_{Notes}((x) - \]
\[Rate_{Notes}((m) \]
\[+ abs( Rate_{Chords}(x) - \]
\[Rate_{Chords}(m)) \]
\[+ abs( Rate_{Rests}(x) - \]
\[Rate_{Rests}(m)) \]
