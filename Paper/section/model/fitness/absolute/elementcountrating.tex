\paragraph{Element count rating}\mbox{}\\
This rating function calculates a score based on the number of elements that appear in a song compared to the master song. This rating function is calculated by the following equation:
% ElementCountRate(x,m) =%
\[\frac{abs( E_{x}-E_{m}) }{E_{x}} \]
with $E_{x}$ and $E_{m}$ the number of elements of the candidate song $x$ and master song $m$ respectively.
