\subsubsection{Absolute rating functions}
The following rating functions compare the master song directyl with the candidate song. These rating functions do not compare the values calculated within the songs, here they calculate this value by directly comparing the songs with each other. For example, instead of comparing the values received from comparing elements from the same song with the master, the absolute rating functions directly compare elements from the song to the master.
