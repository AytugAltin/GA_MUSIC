\subsubsection{Element swap mutation}
This mutation is self-evident: two random elements from the song are swapped. Similarly to the measure swap mutation, the purpose of this mutation is to alter the order of elements in the song.

\subsubsection{Element type mutation}
Here, an element (rest, note or chord) from the song is replaced with another already existing element in the song that has a different type. The duration of the note will be unchanged. This mutation has a direct effect on all the scores that are based on the types of the song.

\subsubsection{Element pitch mutation}
This mutation  transposes a note or a chord within the limits. These limits are determined by the master song. This limit is the same as the limit that defines a wrong interval (see section \ref{sec:rater:neighbourpitch}). This has a direct effect on the neighbor pitch rating.
