\section{Mutation}
In this section, the different types of mutations are described. Mutations introduce new elements in a song, they can have a positive effect, a negative effect or a neutral effect on the total fitness of a song. Some mutations can be seen as optimizations if they guarantee improvement in the total fitness. 

The mutation step is executed if the population become similar. This similarity is calculated by comparing the fitness of the best-rated song with the fitness of the worst-rated song within the population. This value is called the maximum population difference. If this difference is lower than a certain threshold, the population will be mutated, otherwise the mutation step will be skipped. 

Once the population is selected for mutation, a part of the population will be selected for mutation. This is called the "song mutation probability", which is the probability of a song to be selected for mutation.

For each song that is selected for mutation, there is a probability of selecting a particular type of mutation. After executing all the selected mutations on a song, there is a chance for this song to restart the mutation process. This allows the possibility to re-mutate a song multiple times.
