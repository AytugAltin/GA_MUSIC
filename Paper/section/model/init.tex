\subsection{The genetic algorithm}

First the initialisation process will start. During the \textbf{initialisation} the the songs are loaded or created and put into the initial population. The initial population usually consist of a mix of different songs, here we want to make sure we have a diverse population. The size of the population which is static during the execution is decided here. The whole generation algorithm will be configured during this process, things such as filling in parameters also done here.
