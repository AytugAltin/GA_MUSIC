\section{Model}
In this section, each part of the model is discussed. On figure \ref{fig:GA_MODEL} a general overview of the model is illustrated. Before we go into detail, we briefly discuss the different components of our model.

The initial population can consist of both random songs or non-random songs, these are called $GEN0$. The next generation is calculated by applying a crossover function on $GEN0$ to obtain $GEN1$ which is the offspring. Each individual song in the offspring will be rated by the fitness function and obtains a score. Now we can select the best rated songs in $GEN1$ and mutate them. This process is repeated until a certain condition is met or until user is satisfied with the results and manually terminates the loop.
